Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Hedge your crypto portfolio and lower overall risk due to volatility and correlational behavior by moving out part of it into a stable asset: MakerDAO DAI.

Build a balanced portfolio, we will rebalance it for you.

Don't stop there, invest some DAI into a fund which will invest by funding loans in EthLend based on clear rules (eg.: amount, duration, MPR, LTV, etc).
